The future needs sustainable communities in the true definition of that concept. Today, about half of the 6000 or so languages spoken in different parts of the world are under threat: that means that 3000 languages are either seriously endangered or are dying. The need to protect and enhance the diversity of cultures in the world becomes even more urgent in the face of increasing globalization. We need to ensure that an artificial polarization between the needs of the environment and the needs of people is not allowed to develop any further. I welcome the positive and the constructive comments
