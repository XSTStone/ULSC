I shall also send my statement of 22 September, declaring that the European Council is firmly committed to the fight against terrorism, and in which I solemnly confirm the European Union commitment to protecting democratic and the multicultural societies. And lastly, I shall forward my speech that Mrs Banotti referred to, which I gave to the Heads of State at the exceptional meeting of the Heads of State and Government, and which is very clear. I could also add the statements that I made on the Greek television, as I was on an official visit to Greece at that time.
