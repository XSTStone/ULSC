because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter. I do not know whether this information is correct, but the Group would, in any case, be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already. Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind. That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda. Thank you, Mr Poettering. We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request. I do.
