The second, which is probably the most simple and most economic way of combating the greenhouse effect, considering the levels it will have reached by 2020, is to set minimum standards for millions of new household appliances in China alone there will be 100 million new fridges in 2020 for new engines and for millions of new computer tools. If we manage to set minimum standards for these items, we will be taking the simplest and by far the least costly measure, and also the one which will probably have the greatest influence on international policy on the greenhouse effect.
