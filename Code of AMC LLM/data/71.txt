Mr Schultz, I did not interrupt you. I would ask you at least to be polite. Clearly, politeness was not part of your education. Please would you refrain from interrupting and learn some manners above all. Why are you getting so het up Madam President, rather than concerning himself with the internal affairs of the European Peoples Party, Mr Schultz would do well to concentrate on those of his own group, which has a minority in Parliament and lost the elections in Italy. Clearly, this irritable behaviour is the evidence of the political difficulties currently being experienced by his group.
