On 21 September, Toulouse was struck by a disaster on an unprecedented scale, in which 29 people died and 2500 were injured. We have all been concerned and deeply saddened by the suffering of the victims families, of the injured and by the grief of the people of Toulouse. Following the explosion at the AZF factory, I sent a message on behalf of Parliament, and on my own behalf, to the Mayor of Toulouse, Mr Douste Blazy and to his fellow citizens, to express our solidarity and the deepest sympathy. The exact causes of this awful disaster are still unknown.
