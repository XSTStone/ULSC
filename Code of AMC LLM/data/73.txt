I had invited him because he embodied the hopes of the overwhelming majority of people in Afghanistan for a future of peace and freedom. He had warned us against the Taliban regimes tacit support for international terrorism and he did everything in his power to fight against those who misused Islam in order to flout the most basic human rights. He sent a strong message to us to help him to establish peace as soon as possible. I regret that the West did not heed this message and did not do more to help this brave man. Many of you
