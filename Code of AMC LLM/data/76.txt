The UEMOA, whose structure is closely modelled on that of the European Union, plays a key role in the organisation of regional cooperation in West Africa. This is why we hope to build further on the links that already exist between this organisation and the European Union. This is the aim of Mr Toures visit, and I would like to extend a very warm welcome to him. The next item is the Council and Commission statements with a view to the informal and extraordinary meeting of the European Council on Friday 21 September, on the measures needed to tackle terrorism.
