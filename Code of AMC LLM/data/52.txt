Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the President and his colleagues for the fact that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has for once been allowed to see the light of day. This is the first time, as far as I can remember, that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has been able to conduct a debate at a time that might be called in any way normal. It is no doubt a sign that the wind of change is blowing through the Judicial Board for Public Lands and Funds,
