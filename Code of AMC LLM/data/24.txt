The statements we have heard today on the Middle East peace process are very opportune at the moment because of the hurried tour which Minister Gama whose absence from this debate I also regret has made of the region, accompanied by other Council representatives. The tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation. I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation. In this sense I share positive attitude of Commissioner Patten.
