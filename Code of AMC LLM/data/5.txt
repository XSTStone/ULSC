I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated. I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax. The Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda. Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this? Madam President, I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists. I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda
